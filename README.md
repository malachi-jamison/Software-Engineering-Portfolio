# CPT (P)| FA26A Technical Portfolio

## Executive Summary
I am CPT (P) Malachi Jamison. While my military career began in Logistics (Transportation) after commissioning from Morgan State University, my professional trajectory has evolved toward Network Systems Engineering.

Leveraging my off-duty hours as a Lieutenant and Captain, I earned a Master’s Degree in Information Technology (Specialization: Software Engineering). This academic rigor, combined with practical experience in Full-Stack Development and Product Strategy, has prepared me to transition into the FA26A career field. My goal is to bridge the gap between operational Army requirements and modern technical implementation.
